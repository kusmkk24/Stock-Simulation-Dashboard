# Stock Simulation Dashboard

For the Wake Wealth Initiative, this project simulated and tracked stock portfolio performance. Key contributions included:

* Using Python and Yahoo Finance to pull stock data, including industry and sector information for portfolio tickers.
* Running simulations based on participants' portfolio allocations and tracking daily changes in portfolio values.
* Developing an interactive dashboard to visualize participantsâ€™ progress, rank portfolios, and compare performance.
  
The dashboard served as an engaging tool for monitoring portfolio performance and understanding market trends.
